TITLE: -
Introduction to Python 

AIM: -
 To understand the basics of Python programming and execute a Python File that demonstrates its fundamental concepts. 

TOOLS USED: -
-	Programming Language – Python 
-	Software – Google Colab 

THEORY: -
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 
It consists of an easy-to-understand syntax, which makes it ideal for beginners. 

This Python file consists of: -
-	Basic Python concepts such as: -
1.	Variables
2.	Data Types 
3.	Print statements to display text and numbers 
4.	Comments for code documentation 
5.	Case sensitivity in Python Variables 
6.	Basic Arithmetic operations 
7.	Boolean expressions for comparison operations
8.	Input and Output Functions 
9.	Simple Statements and Logics 
10.	Some Problem Statements 
One important piece of information is that Python does not require compilation; the code is executed directly using the Python interpreter. 

CONCLUSION: -
The Python file was successfully created and executed. Through this program, basic Python Programming concepts were understood clearly. This experiment helped in building a strong foundation for writing simple Python programs and understanding the execution flow of Python code.
